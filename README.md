I built a basic password strength checker using Python as a way to better understand input validation and common password security principles. The program runs in the terminal and prompts the user to enter a password. It checks for multiple criteria like length (minimum 12 characters), use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

I used Python's built-in `re` module to perform pattern matching on the password input. If the password fails any of the checks, the program lists the specific issues and prompts the user to try again. The loop continues until the user creates a password that meets all security requirements.

This project helped reinforce the importance of password complexity in cybersecurity and gave me hands-on practice writing secure input logic, using regular expressions, and building interactive command-line tools. Itâ€™s a small but practical example of how to encourage secure user behavior through code.
